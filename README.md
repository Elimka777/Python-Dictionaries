# ⁘⁘⁘ Assignments: Python Dictionaries ⁘⁘⁘

Student: Elima

This assignment consists of 4 main applications:
1. Real-World Python Dictionary Applications - I practiced updating a restaurant menu by adding, changing, and removing items. This helped me understand how to work with complex data in a simple way.
2. Advanced Data Handling with Python - I worked on real-world tasks that involve using dictionaries and nested collections, and I created my functions to process data.
3. Python Programming Challenges for Customer Service Data Handling - I practiced fixing code, organizing customer information, and creating a feedback system using dictionaries.
4. Python Essentials for Business Analytics - I practiced copying dictionaries, using built-in methods, managing nested collections, and handling errors with try-except blocks.
